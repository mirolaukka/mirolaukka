# My Recent Projects

- [mirolaukka](https://github.com/mirolaukka/mirolaukka) - None
- [population-dynamics-simulation](https://github.com/mirolaukka/population-dynamics-simulation) - Predator-Prey Ecosystem Simulation, where Python is used to model and visualize the population dynamics of prey and predator populations over time with adjustable parameters.
- [sir-model-simulation](https://github.com/mirolaukka/sir-model-simulation) - Epidemic Spreading Simulation using the SIR model, allowing users to visualize the spread of disease and understand its dynamics with adjustable parameters.
- [subreddit-shortcut-firefox](https://github.com/mirolaukka/subreddit-shortcut-firefox) - Subreddit Redirect Shortcut is a lightweight Firefox extension that automatically redirects searches for specific subreddits to the corresponding subreddit page on Reddit. 
- [reinforcement-learning](https://github.com/mirolaukka/reinforcement-learning) - This is a repo to document and save my progress while learning to use reinforcement learning in Python
